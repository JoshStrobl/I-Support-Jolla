						<p><a href="https://jolla.com" target="_blank" tabindex="5">Jolla</a> creates choice and diversity in
						the mobile ecosystem by providing an independent, alternative mobile operating system, called Sailfish OS.</p>
						<h2>Why is Sailfish OS important?</h2>
						<p>Sailfish OS is important because it provides an ecosystem that is free from the privacy concerns of
						Google and its Android platform, the walled garden of Apple's iOS, and questionable ethics of Microsoft.</p>
						<p>When I purchased my Jolla Phone in early 2014, the ecosystem was ripe with fantastic applications and
						using Sailfish OS further encouraged me to evaluate more of the online services I used on a daily basis.
						It enabled me to use a truly "People Powered" device and experience, with a team that is heavily
						involved in the community, taking in people's thoughts and ideas to create a truly personal experience.</p>
						<h2>Their Values: Love, Transparency, Passion, Respect</h2>
						<p>	When I had the opportunity to visit their office here in Tampere, Finland, you could really see that the
						values they speak of aren't just hollow words, they are instilled in every Sailor. Their values are unlike,
						their pride in where they are sailing and their mission is outright obvious, and love for the community
						is unquestionable.</p>
						<p>Sometimes a boat needs fixing.</p>
						<p>Jolla is currently undergoing financial difficulty and sadly has needed to temporarily lay off staff and
						file for debt restructuring. As a community, we can help fix their boat, by showing our support through
						the rocky waves and telling them that we support their endeavor for a truly independent mobile OS.</p>
